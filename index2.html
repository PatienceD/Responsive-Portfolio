      <p> I was originally born in Columbia South Carolina. When my parents got divorced, my mom,
        brother,
        and
        I
        moved in with my grandparents in southern New Hampshire. I spent the majority of my life
        shoveling
        snow,
        hiking mountains, and falling in love with the way the leaves changed colors in the fall.
        Throughout
        my
        high school years, I experimented with different artistic styles like painting, pottery,
        drawing,
        and
        later, photography. I became captivated by film photography and dedicated my last 2 years of
        high
        school
        to nothing but the arts. Towards the end of high school, I found myself seeing photography
        as
        more
        of a
        hobby instead of a job. Scratching all my college plans, I graduated high school without any
        idea of
        longterm work and found myself working full-time. </p>
      <p>When the opportunity emerged to move to Florida, I didn’t miss a beat packing my bags. Once
        settled
        in, I
        begin to expand my comfort zone and started self-teaching myself the fundamentals of reading
        and
        writing
        code. I wanted to grow my knowledge further and thus, applied for UCF’s Coding BootCamp.
